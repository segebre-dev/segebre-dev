While I could delve into the technical details of JavaScript's single-threaded asynchronicity, I believe there is already [a highly informative and widely shared technical explanation available on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ). Therefore, I will try to introduce the topic in a more accessible manner that anyone, regardless of technical knowledge, can understand.

## The Situation

JavaScript (JS) is a single-threaded language, which means that it operates like an individual doing a job, as opposed to a multi-threaded language which operates like a team doing a job. As a single thread, it cannot work on anything other than the current task.

Despite this limitation, we can achieve asynchronous behavior when working with JavaScript. For example, we can make multiple requests for information simultaneously without having to wait for each one to finish before making the subsequent request.

> JavaScript is a single-threaded language. So how is it asynchronous?

## The Analogy

<CalloutBlock icon="ℹ️">

    'This post is targeted at how JavaScript runs in the browser, however, many of these concepts translate to other runtime environments (e.g. Node.js).'
  }
</CalloutBlock>

To simplify the different elements that take part in the analogy, I will gradually introduce them along the way. As I introduce the elements, I will leave callback blocks as quick references in case you need to refer back to something.

### The setup

Let's imagine we have a <span aria-hidden>🛖</span> restaurant with only one <span aria-hidden>🧵</span>waitperson.

<CalloutBlock icon="🛖">restaurant = Website</CalloutBlock>

The <span aria-hidden>🧵</span>waitperson is our interface to ask questions, get answers, and perform actions.

<CalloutBlock icon="🧵">waitperson = main JS thread</CalloutBlock>

The <span aria-hidden>🧵</span>waitperson can only attend to one <span aria-hidden>📝</span>order at a time. However, getting the client's order does NOT occur sequentially. Instead, everyone’s food goes through the same process of ordering, preparing, and serving at the “same time”. But there is only a single <span aria-hidden>🧵</span>waitperson, so how do they manage it? 🤔

<CalloutBlock icon="📝">order = JS command</CalloutBlock>

### The flow

In this case, the <span aria-hidden>🛖</span>restaurant has more going on than the customers get to see. For example, it needs a <span aria-hidden>⚙</span>kitchen to work. The customer usually does not know what is happening inside the <span aria-hidden>⚙</span>kitchen, yet it handles much of the work required to deliver what they ordered. So, what is the flow here, and, once again, how does one <span aria-hidden>🧵</span>waitperson manage to serve all the <span aria-hidden>📝</span>orders concurrently?

<CalloutBlock icon="⚙">kitchen = Browser</CalloutBlock>

Let's break it down:

1. A customer makes an <span aria-hidden>📝</span>order; during this time, the <span aria-hidden>🧵</span>waitperson is blocked and cannot answer anyone else or do anything else during this time.
2. Once that is finished, the <span aria-hidden>🧵</span>waitperson either immediately fulfills the request(e.g. the customer asks for a straw) or takes the <span aria-hidden>📝</span>order to the <span aria-hidden>⚙</span>kitchen.
3. The <span aria-hidden>⚙</span>kitchen prepares the <span aria-hidden>📝</span>order using <span aria-hidden>🔪</span>kitchen utensils and tools.
4. Once the <span aria-hidden>📝</span>order is done, <span aria-hidden>⚙</span>the kitchen puts it on the <span aria-hidden>🛎️</span>counter.
5. Eventually, when the <span aria-hidden>🧵</span>waitperson is free, the <span aria-hidden>🧑‍🍳</span>kitchen assistant (who is needed in this case to coordinate between the busy <span aria-hidden>🧵</span>waitperson and <span aria-hidden>⚙</span>kitchen) picks up the order from the <span aria-hidden>🛎️</span>counter and gives it to the <span aria-hidden>🧵</span>waitperson.
6. The <span aria-hidden>🧵</span>waitperson then delivers it to the customers.

<CalloutBlock icon="🔪">kitchen utensils and tools = Web APIs</CalloutBlock>

<CalloutBlock icon="🧑‍🍳">kitchen assistant = The event loop</CalloutBlock>

<CalloutBlock icon="🛎️">counter = The task queue</CalloutBlock>

## In conclusion

The beauty of this is that during steps 3 and 4, the <span aria-hidden>🧵</span>waitperson is free and can do other things. So, the <span aria-hidden>🧵</span>waitperson returns to other customers and gets more <span aria-hidden>📝</span>orders, and the process repeats.

Steps 1, 2, 5, and 6 can ONLY be done sequentially; in other words, the waiter cannot take two tables' <span aria-hidden>📝</span>orders simultaneously. However, steps 3 and 4 can happen in parallel, the <span aria-hidden>⚙</span>kitchen can and will cook as many <span aria-hidden>📝</span>orders as possible.

Interestingly enough, the <span aria-hidden>🧵</span>waitperson steps tend to be quick, and the <span aria-hidden>⚙</span>kitchen steps tend to be slow. Still, the <span aria-hidden>⚙</span>kitchen has more than one person working on the orders, so everything works smoothly and seems to happen fully in parallel.

Note that it is critically important that you do not give long tasks to the <span aria-hidden>🧵</span>waitperson; If you do, for example, ask the <span aria-hidden>🧵</span>waitperson to cook, then they will be blocked in cooking while customers are waiting to place their <span aria-hidden>📝</span>orders. No one answers their calls and rings, making it seem like the <span aria-hidden>🛖</span>restaurant is frozen.

I guess now we know why websites that use JavaScript freeze sometimes. 🤓

I hope this analogy helps you. If it does, please reach out; I'd love to know about it! If it did not, or something is incorrect, let me know; I'm always happy to learn and improve.
